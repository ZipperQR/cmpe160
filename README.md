# cmpe160
Contains the tutorial material prepared for Introduction to Object Oriented Progamming(CmpE 160) course in Bogazici University, Spring 2016 semester. Visualization is the main aspect in most of the projects. We decided to go with ACM Java Task Force packages. See http://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/jtf/ for more detail.

##  TicTacToe
Contains the implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe game, aka X-O-X. We mainly focus on the pedagogical aspects of the code. So, implementation is not perfect but a good starting point to teach the basics of OOP.
